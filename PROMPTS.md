# Conversation Prompts

This document contains the chronological list of prompts that were used to build the FTL MCP server project.

## 1. Initial Analysis and Setup

**Prompt:** "Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for future Claude Code instances"

*Created initial CLAUDE.md guidance file and analyzed the minimal repository structure.*

## 2. Python Package Creation

**Prompt:** "Create a python package named ftl_mcp and the associated files like pyproject.toml"

*Set up the basic Python package structure with pyproject.toml configuration.*

## 3. FastMCP Dependency

**Prompt:** "Add fastmcp as a requirement"

*Added FastMCP framework as a dependency to the project.*

## 4. MCP Server Implementation

**Prompt:** "Create an example mcp server using fastmcp"

*Built the initial MCP server with basic tools and resources using FastMCP decorators.*

## 5. Unit Testing

**Prompt:** "Yes create some basic unit tests"

*Created comprehensive unit tests for all tools and resources.*

## 6. Test Execution

**Prompt:** "run the unit tests again"

*Executed tests to verify functionality (all 17 tests passed).*

## 7. Documentation

**Prompt:** "Update the README.md for this repo"

*Updated README with comprehensive documentation of features and usage.*

## 8. Example Client

**Prompt:** "Write an example fastmcp client that works with the example fastmcp server"

*Created a complete client demonstrating all server functionality.*

## 9. Virtual Environment Setup

**Prompt:** "source ~/venv/ftl/bin/activate before running python or pytest commands. Add that to CLAUDE.md"

*Updated CLAUDE.md with virtual environment activation instructions.*

## 10. Test Verification

**Prompt:** "Run pytest -v"

*Ran comprehensive test suite to ensure all functionality works correctly.*

## 11. Context Variables Integration

**Prompt:** "Add context variables to the mcp tools like shown on this page: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context"

*Enhanced tools with FastMCP context variables for logging and client tracking.*

## 12. State Management Example

**Prompt:** "Add an example that show how to use state management with context in an mcp.tool"

*Implemented FTL mission control tools demonstrating context state management.*

## 13. Ansible Inventory Loading

**Prompt:** "Add a tool called load_inventory that loads a Ansible yaml formatted inventory into the context state management"

*Created comprehensive Ansible inventory loading and parsing functionality.*

## 14. Ansible Inventory Saving

**Prompt:** "Add a tool called save_inventory that writes a Ansible yaml formatted inventory from the context state management"

*Added inventory export functionality to write YAML files from context state.*

## 15. Session ID Management

**Prompt:** "Add an example mcp.tool that uses the sessionid"

*Implemented session tracking and management tools using FastMCP session IDs.*

## 16. Prompt Documentation

**Prompt:** "What are the previous prompts that I have sent to you?"

*Request to document the conversation history (this document).*

## 17. Documentation Maintenance

**Prompt:** "Append any future prompts to PROMPTS.md"

*Instruction to maintain ongoing documentation of conversation prompts.*

## Project Evolution Summary

The project evolved through these phases:

1. **Setup Phase** (Prompts 1-3): Initial repository analysis and Python package creation
2. **Core Implementation** (Prompts 4-6): Basic MCP server with tools, resources, and tests
3. **Documentation & Client** (Prompts 7-10): README updates, example client, and environment setup
4. **Advanced Features** (Prompts 11-15): Context variables, state management, Ansible integration, session tracking
5. **Documentation** (Prompt 16): Conversation history documentation

Each prompt built upon the previous work, creating a comprehensive FastMCP server demonstrating:
- Basic MCP tool and resource patterns
- Context variables and logging
- State management across tool calls
- Complex data parsing and persistence
- Session isolation and tracking
- Real-world use cases (Ansible inventory management)

The final result is a production-ready example showcasing FastMCP's full capabilities.
