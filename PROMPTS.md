# Conversation Prompts

This document contains the chronological list of prompts that were used to build the FTL MCP server project.

## 1. Initial Analysis and Setup

**Prompt:** "Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for future Claude Code instances"

*Created initial CLAUDE.md guidance file and analyzed the minimal repository structure.*

## 2. Python Package Creation

**Prompt:** "Create a python package named ftl_mcp and the associated files like pyproject.toml"

*Set up the basic Python package structure with pyproject.toml configuration.*

## 3. FastMCP Dependency

**Prompt:** "Add fastmcp as a requirement"

*Added FastMCP framework as a dependency to the project.*

## 4. MCP Server Implementation

**Prompt:** "Create an example mcp server using fastmcp"

*Built the initial MCP server with basic tools and resources using FastMCP decorators.*

## 5. Unit Testing

**Prompt:** "Yes create some basic unit tests"

*Created comprehensive unit tests for all tools and resources.*

## 6. Test Execution

**Prompt:** "run the unit tests again"

*Executed tests to verify functionality (all 17 tests passed).*

## 7. Documentation

**Prompt:** "Update the README.md for this repo"

*Updated README with comprehensive documentation of features and usage.*

## 8. Example Client

**Prompt:** "Write an example fastmcp client that works with the example fastmcp server"

*Created a complete client demonstrating all server functionality.*

## 9. Virtual Environment Setup

**Prompt:** "source ~/venv/ftl/bin/activate before running python or pytest commands. Add that to CLAUDE.md"

*Updated CLAUDE.md with virtual environment activation instructions.*

## 10. Test Verification

**Prompt:** "Run pytest -v"

*Ran comprehensive test suite to ensure all functionality works correctly.*

## 11. Context Variables Integration

**Prompt:** "Add context variables to the mcp tools like shown on this page: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context"

*Enhanced tools with FastMCP context variables for logging and client tracking.*

## 12. State Management Example

**Prompt:** "Add an example that show how to use state management with context in an mcp.tool"

*Implemented FTL mission control tools demonstrating context state management.*

## 13. Ansible Inventory Loading

**Prompt:** "Add a tool called load_inventory that loads a Ansible yaml formatted inventory into the context state management"

*Created comprehensive Ansible inventory loading and parsing functionality.*

## 14. Ansible Inventory Saving

**Prompt:** "Add a tool called save_inventory that writes a Ansible yaml formatted inventory from the context state management"

*Added inventory export functionality to write YAML files from context state.*

## 15. Session ID Management

**Prompt:** "Add an example mcp.tool that uses the sessionid"

*Implemented session tracking and management tools using FastMCP session IDs.*

## 16. Prompt Documentation

**Prompt:** "What are the previous prompts that I have sent to you?"

*Request to document the conversation history (this document).*

## 17. Documentation Maintenance

**Prompt:** "Append any future prompts to PROMPTS.md"

*Instruction to maintain ongoing documentation of conversation prompts.*

## 18. Context State Clarification

**Prompt:** "Apparently context state is not persisted between requests, so to have persistent state we need to store it in global memory. This was not very clear in the documentation."

*Important clarification about FastMCP context state behavior - context state doesn't persist between requests, requiring global memory for persistent state.*

## 19. In-Memory Storage Recommendations

**Prompt:** "What in-memory storage mechanism would you suggest for storing JSON compatible datastructures?"

*Request for recommendations on persistent in-memory storage solutions for JSON-compatible data.*

## 20. State Manager Implementation

**Prompt:** "Add the StateManager to state.py and import that into server.py"

*Implementation of proper state management with Pydantic models for type safety and validation.*

## 21. State Manager Testing

**Prompt:** "Write unit tests for the state manager."

*Request for comprehensive unit tests to validate StateManager functionality and Pydantic models.*

## 22. Context State Cleanup

**Prompt:** "Remove calls to ctx.set_state and ctx.get_state since that was not effective."

*Successfully cleaned up all ineffective FastMCP context state calls. The server now relies solely on StateManager for sessions/missions and _inventory_storage for inventory data. All ctx.set_state() and ctx.get_state() calls have been removed from server.py.*

## 23. FTL Mission Tools Removal

**Prompt:** "Remove the ftl_mission tool examples."

*Removed all FTL mission-related tools from server.py (start_ftl_mission, update_ftl_mission, get_ftl_mission_status, complete_ftl_mission). Cleaned up imports removing unused MissionAlert and MissionData models. Updated README.md to remove mission tool documentation. All tests continue to pass.*

## 24. Mission Models and State Cleanup

**Prompt:** "Remove MissionAlert and MissionData from state along with the associated functions and tests."

*Completely removed MissionAlert and MissionData Pydantic models from state.py. Removed all mission-related StateManager methods (set_current_mission, get_current_mission, set_mission_history, get_mission_history, set_last_completed_mission, get_last_completed_mission). Updated StateManager statistics and JSON export to exclude mission references. Removed all mission-related tests from test_state.py including test_mission_alert_creation, test_mission_data_creation, test_mission_management, test_mission_completion, and mission references in integration tests. Modified concurrent data management test to focus on sessions/inventory/generic storage without missions. All 40 tests pass.*

## 25. Inventory Integration Tests

**Prompt:** "Using the file inventory.yml write a test that loads the inventory and checks that localhost is in the inventory the state."

*Created comprehensive integration tests for MCP server tools using FastMCP Client pattern. Added test_server_integration.py with 4 tests: test_load_inventory_with_localhost (verifies localhost loading and details), test_load_inventory_localhost_in_all_group (checks group associations), test_inventory_state_persistence (tests tool interaction flow), and test_load_inventory_file_not_found (error handling). Fixed bug in load_inventory function where 'all' group hosts weren't being processed - added process_group("all", value) to handle direct hosts under 'all' group. All 44 tests pass including the new integration tests that successfully load inventory.yml and verify localhost is present with correct ansible_connection=local configuration.*

## Project Evolution Summary

The project evolved through these phases:

1. **Setup Phase** (Prompts 1-3): Initial repository analysis and Python package creation
2. **Core Implementation** (Prompts 4-6): Basic MCP server with tools, resources, and tests
3. **Documentation & Client** (Prompts 7-10): README updates, example client, and environment setup
4. **Advanced Features** (Prompts 11-15): Context variables, state management, Ansible integration, session tracking
5. **Documentation** (Prompt 16): Conversation history documentation

Each prompt built upon the previous work, creating a comprehensive FastMCP server demonstrating:
- Basic MCP tool and resource patterns
- Context variables and logging
- State management across tool calls
- Complex data parsing and persistence
- Session isolation and tracking
- Real-world use cases (Ansible inventory management)

The final result is a production-ready example showcasing FastMCP's full capabilities.
