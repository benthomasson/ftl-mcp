## 22. Context State Cleanup

**Prompt:** "Remove calls to ctx.set_state and ctx.get_state since that was not effective."

*Successfully cleaned up all ineffective FastMCP context state calls. The server now relies solely on StateManager for sessions/missions and _inventory_storage for inventory data. All ctx.set_state() and ctx.get_state() calls have been removed from server.py.*

## 23. FTL Mission Tools Removal

**Prompt:** "Remove the ftl_mission tool examples."

*Removed all FTL mission-related tools from server.py (start_ftl_mission, update_ftl_mission, get_ftl_mission_status, complete_ftl_mission). Cleaned up imports removing unused MissionAlert and MissionData models. Updated README.md to remove mission tool documentation. All tests continue to pass.*

## 24. Mission Models and State Cleanup

**Prompt:** "Remove MissionAlert and MissionData from state along with the associated functions and tests."

*Completely removed MissionAlert and MissionData Pydantic models from state.py. Removed all mission-related StateManager methods (set_current_mission, get_current_mission, set_mission_history, get_mission_history, set_last_completed_mission, get_last_completed_mission). Updated StateManager statistics and JSON export to exclude mission references. Removed all mission-related tests from test_state.py including test_mission_alert_creation, test_mission_data_creation, test_mission_management, test_mission_completion, and mission references in integration tests. Modified concurrent data management test to focus on sessions/inventory/generic storage without missions. All 40 tests pass.*

## 25. Inventory Integration Tests

**Prompt:** "Using the file inventory.yml write a test that loads the inventory and checks that localhost is in the inventory the state."

*Created comprehensive integration tests for MCP server tools using FastMCP Client pattern. Added test_server_integration.py with 4 tests: test_load_inventory_with_localhost (verifies localhost loading and details), test_load_inventory_localhost_in_all_group (checks group associations), test_inventory_state_persistence (tests tool interaction flow), and test_load_inventory_file_not_found (error handling). Fixed bug in load_inventory function where 'all' group hosts weren't being processed - added process_group("all", value) to handle direct hosts under 'all' group. All 44 tests pass including the new integration tests that successfully load inventory.yml and verify localhost is present with correct ansible_connection=local configuration.*

## 26. Add faster_than_light Dependency

**Prompt:** "Add faster_than_light as a dependency for this project."

*Added faster_than_light to the dependencies list in pyproject.toml. The package is now included alongside the existing dependencies (mcp, pydantic, anyio, fastmcp, PyYAML) and will be installed when the project is installed.*

## 27. faster_than_light Project Analysis

**Prompt:** "Read about the faster_than_light project here /Users/ai/git/faster-than-light/README.md"

*Read and analyzed the faster_than_light README.md to understand its capabilities as a high-performance automation framework. Key insights: async-first architecture, 2-10x faster than Ansible, compatible with Ansible modules, supports SSH gates and connection pooling.*

## 28. MCP Tool Interfaces for Ansible Modules

**Prompt:** "I would like to make mcp.tool interfaces for ansible modules and use faster_than_light to handle remote execution"

*Initial request to create MCP tool interfaces for Ansible modules using faster_than_light as the execution backend.*

## 29. Implementation Planning

**Prompt:** "Write out your plan to PLAN.md first"

*Created comprehensive PLAN.md with 4-phase implementation approach: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure), Phase 2 (MCP Tool Implementation), Phase 3 (Advanced Integration), Phase 4 (Advanced Automation). Detailed architecture vision showing MCP Client → FTL MCP Server → faster_than_light execution flow with StateManager integration.*

## 30. Implementation Authorization

**Prompt:** "Yes"

*Authorization to proceed with the implementation plan.*

## 31. Testing Module Guidance

**Prompt:** "Use the argtest module for testing"

*Guidance to use faster_than_light's argtest module for testing instead of standard Ansible modules that weren't available.*

## 32. Code Style Instruction

**Prompt:** "Do not comment out code, just remove it"

*Instruction to remove problematic code instead of commenting it out when fixing tests.*

## 33. Virtual Environment Reminder

**Prompt:** "Always source ~/venv/ftl/bin/activate before running commands"

*Reminder to activate the virtual environment before running Python commands.*

## 34. Specific Module Tools Question

**Prompt:** "I'd like to make mcp.tools for specific modules. Would this be useful or confusing for mcp clients like Claude code?"

*Discussion about creating specific MCP tools for individual Ansible modules vs keeping the generic ansible_module tool. Recommendation to use both approaches for optimal user experience.*

## 35. Tool Capacity Question

**Prompt:** "How many tools can Claude Code support at once without getting confused or forgetting some?"

*Inquiry about practical limits for MCP tool count. Guidance provided: 15-30 tools is optimal, 30-50 is manageable, 50+ becomes challenging. Recommended starting with 8-12 specific Ansible module tools plus the generic tool.*

## 36. Playbook Generation Request

**Prompt:** "I'd like to add a log of tasks run to the mcp server so that we can generate playbooks as we go. How would we do that?"

*Request to implement task logging for automatic playbook generation, creating an "Infrastructure as Code" workflow where manual operations become replayable playbooks.*

## 37. Playbook Implementation Authorization

**Prompt:** "yes make these changes"

*Authorization to implement the complete playbook generation system including TaskLogger, task logging integration, and new MCP tools (get_playbook_tasks, generate_playbook, clear_playbook_tasks).*

## 38. Documentation Update Request

**Prompt:** "Update PROMPTS.md with all the prompts that I have entered so far. Don't remove existing prompts if you forgot them due to compacting the history."

*Request to update PROMPTS.md with all conversation prompts while preserving existing entries.*
